*Ideas be like*
# TYPES OF INK: ==============================================================================================================
So I think I've mentioned using diff colours of ink already, buut another cool idea: what if it's not just diff colours. We could have some text written in invisible ink, maybe even something with glow in the dark stuff? could experiment with different viscousity inks too, or even use paint in places. Personally I'm a big fan of the idea of using invisible ink to draw over the text, or place hidden messages / bits of lore n stuff.

//? Would have to experiment a lot with this to see what works and what doesn't

# KICKSTARTER TIERS: ==============================================================================================================
Like I mentioned: Could base the tier names on ranks in freemasonry (obviously ockultified and shit).
//! a lot of these are pretty dedicated and would be hard to pull off, we might wanna go for the simpler options
Additionally got some reward ideas (this also includes the old ones for documentation purposes):
- Casette tape, 30 min long. 15 min each side; should prob be a 2 track album. [2]
- Pouch of salt, bag is made of fabric, hempen string ties it together. [3]
- A stack of burnt, torn, and otherwise damaged papers. When placed on the floor in certain positions will reveal a summoning circle. As well as all of the gameplay mechanics, as it gets towards the centre it gets gradualy more burnt [1]
- Occult items listed in a scroll // could be an "every tier" thing
- bloodstained candles [5]
- Personalized note, scroll, something
- The funder will have their name be listed as one of the books "editors", providing some notes of their own for the book
- Goat skull [4]
- handmade bronze dagger, with runes n shit on it, signed by us both [6]
- Candles that reveal psalms or scriptures as they get melted, can be used as the miserie clock for the game. [7]
- 1-3 zero for all

//? [1] given that we want em to form an image we'd need either 4, 9, 16, or 32 pages. ya know N to the 2nd power. 
//? [2] the actual contents will be figured out with the band that we choose to collaborate with.
//? [3] could grow some salt crystals myself to get some large ones
//? [4] hard to make this Saline Scriptures themed so might be a pass
//? [5] kinda dedicated, and pretty weird. Not sure if people would exactly want this.
//? [6] this one's damn dedicated, but as a one-off for the highest tier it might be viable
//? [7] Not a huge fan given how dedicated this is + no idea how much would people want something like this

# DESIGN: ==============================================================================================================
Mostly physical stuff regarding the cover and inserts:
1. the book is bound with a long strip of paper that has scriptures written on it. Must be torn to open the book [1]
2. Different types of paper, handwriting styles, kinds of ink, etc. for every editor.
3. some of the inserts might not be related to the book at all like scraps of newspapers [2] 
4. Gotta keep it all true KVLT

//? [1] an idea: make the text on the seal a warning about the book
//? [2] not related at the first glance that is... the newspapers could be detailing stories of a cult found somewhere, church burnings, murders, etc.

# MECHANICS: ==============================================================================================================
had a big think, and we might wanna limit the amount unique results per broken table to 8, saves space and time. Additionally:
- Add a special table for explosives (and maybe bullets?) [2]
- might group acid into burning, chemical burn is still a burn! [1]
- We're missing a table to put electricity

Here's glaring flaws I've found with the base tables:
- Piercing table is meant for projectiles, it falls apart completely with like a spear
- poison and acid are grouped together, even tho they're fundamentally different
- no table for electricity, explosions, and stuff like that
- 

//? [1] ok on the chemical level they're different, but the results are somewhat similar. So I think they should still be grouped... unless ye think it's a good option to have a "corrosive" table for acids n shit.
//? [2] alternatively put bulets into a table with arrows and other projectiles, and have a separate table for explosions? ooor even wackier option: also combine the ripping and piercing tables into one, given that piercing would basically become obsolete.
