//! Important info will be arked like this

//? Good luck going though the mess of footnotes I left 
//?welcome to my mind, I tried making this as much of an unfiltered stream of thoughts as possible

//! This is a longer read so buckle up
//! Oh and PLEASE do send me commentary as yer reading this
//! No spoilers here btw
//! This is all speculation

// Don't think I need to state this, but I will anyway: What we're doing is avant-garde even for mork borg standards

*Chills' Voice*
[...] and here's the top 5 craziest ideas:

# Number One:
Ye know the novel "House of Leaves" by Mark Z. Danielewski? // if not I *strongly* recommend checking it out  
It's a highly experimental and avant-garde bit of art. The formatting falls appart as ye read further into the book, with some pages having text at weird angles, spacings, shapes, and sometimes being even mirrored. The whole thing is a maze of footnotes feeding diff footnotes, with some being several pages from the text that they're referencing.  
So I had this idea: why not take a bit of that and do it with salamender? obviously not even close to the extent that HoL does it too, but still... A good occult book has to have at least a few layers of footnotes and entries as it was passed through several dozen readers.  

A few Ideas I had for that are the following[^1] : 
- scratched out original text with a "correction" above by someone. Importantly the original text must still be sort of deciferable so the reader has to decide which is the "true" one. [^1.4]
- Notes on margins, and everywhere else. Observations and annotations written by the previous owners [^1.2].
- drawings and sketches of varying quality
- Mirrored text //dunno when it would make sense, but we can always find a way
- Some Text, and especially notes might be in different languages. I'm talking Latin and Hebrew [^1.3]
- While not HoL Inspired: Occult symbolism, imagery, etc. everywhere

Should Also enchourage the reader to leave their own notes and interpretation of the text

### Number 1.5? 
// Didn't think this needed a separate section  
An idea for the miseries table: when we have the "Roll a dice to see if a misery happens that day", what if we make like a chain of dice, each subsequent being differently scratched out, presumeably by the previous readers; Each pitching in and decreasing the size further and ending at a d1 [^1.5]

[1]: Some might be using diff kinds of ink, or even blood  
[^1.2]: Could even create a few styles for frequent "editors", making it possible to figure out that two things were written by two people.
[^1.3] I myself do know a bit of latin, but we would have to find someone that speaks Hebrew
[^1.4] Would also add to the whole "every game is unique" aspect, given that every GM might interpret stuff differently
[^1.5] kinda like this: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/870421199124070420/1048455377349513386/P_20221203_052708.jpg

# Number Two: ==============================================================================================================
Had an idea for the possible kickstarter or whatever;
For higher tiers offer a *limited edition tape only album* composed by Me [1]
It's gonna be avant-garde atmospheric black metal with elements of doom, darkfolk, and dark ambient.
So whatcha think? Is this a good idea or is it just wasting time?

### Number 2.5 I guess //! This is tips I've gotten from wiz bout the funding sort of stuff

//? [1] Will prob collaborate with a metal band on this.

# Number Three: ==============================================================================================================
//! This is potentially a really good or a kinda bad idea
Create a *redux* version of an ARG and hide it inside of the book; In the form of codes, symbols, and maybe even stuff in the before mantioned album. Its a good way to add hidden lore and mystique, While also potentially increasing the engagement of the fanbase.

I personally love myself a good arg, and also created a few of my own // although they weren't really... popular

# Number Four: ==============================================================================================================
//! this is just suggestions for the workflow / plan of action we shoukld use
So right now we're getting the game rules done; great! but I think we should keep the workflow of stuff to this: [2]
- Write out a sketch, rough idea so we understand it
- Annotation sketch
- Compile the latter
- make sure it all meshes together (or is balanced when it comes to rules n mechanics n shite) [1]
- morkultify pass // ya see? its a portmanteau of mork, occult, and -ify
- Lynnify pass //! loop the loop back to the last
- Master Lit. pass (hammering out the kinks and polishing the edges)
- Formatting
- Formatting Morkultify pass // Might need return to the Lynnify pass
- Design Pass
- Design Morkultify pass // Might need return to the Formatting Pass
- Master pass
- Publishing pass
- Print Pass // if

//? [1] Sometimes we might wanna make something not entirely mesh, or present cotradictory information to turn up the mystery and give the reader a way to interpreit and fill the gaps on their own (don't this too much tho as it might get jarring)
//? [2] Loose pages and some non standard bits may deviate from this workflow

# Number Five: ==============================================================================================================
Had this idea before; but I expanded onto it after seeing "S." by JJ.Abrams.
Inserts! Ripped pages, Stray notes, letters, etc Inserted in between the book's pages. Some might be an expansion of the text on the page, or maybe completely unrelated, and referencing something else. [1]

### Number 5.5
additional thing that I think would be super cool: uniqely pre-damage the book; splashing bits of ink on some pages, fingerprints with ink, burned corners [3], etc. 
Nothing to actually damage the contents, just add flavour and immersion. [2] 

//? [1] The character sheet should also be treated this way, although now thinking about it: we'll have to do a series of fairly serious revision passes on the sheet itself.
//? [2] Inspired in part by "Scortch Atlas" by Blake Butler and a book I've had a few years back which's point was to destroy it.
//? [3] similar to this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/870421199124070420/1048497047235473479/P_20221203_081224.jpg

# Bonus Idea: ==============================================================================================================
We should create a design guide encompassing all aspects of the book including: // but not limited to
- Graphic Design
- Formatting
- Writing Style
- Atmosphere and Feel
- Art Style
-
