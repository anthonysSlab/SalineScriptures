# IDEAS:

Note: There are 9 (Including likeable) feats that need to be made.

*Italics are rework ideas*

// are comments

- Interrupter
    - (AGI +2)
    - Once per combat you may sacrifice your next turn, to intercept into an enemy's action, DR12 Agility to either: stop their turn, attack them, or do something else right before they do.

- Inventive
    - (PRE +1, STR +1)
    - Improvised and broken weapons are d6 but they break after one hit. // approved the broken thing

- Culveriner
    - Spend an omen to succeed an attack on a unaware enemy with a gun 
    - Crits give you an omen, taking damage removes one.

- Hoarder
    - Can find extra items with a dr16 presense roll, they are mundane
    - Can carry 2 more items, to the total of 16
    - *when looting 1 in 6 chance to find extra loot*
    // might need a rework

- extreme version of lucky?
    - every failure is a fumble but every success is a crit.
    - *in stessful situations, -4DR to every test but failures fumble.*
    // "stressful" may be too vague 

- Noble Soul
    - Lose 1 omen when lying, 3 max omens.
    - Lying tests are always successful.

- Tempered mind (brave guy thing): You prefer looking death in the eyes instead of hiding like a coward.
    - You don't roll morale and can't be demoralized.
    - Test DR18 Will to withdrawl from combat.
    // needs rephrasing

- Bulwark
    - (STR +2, TOU +1)
    - Defence is a DR8 toughness test, success reduces damage taken by d4.
    // needs rephrasing

- Masochist
    - Losing more than half your max hp in a fight gives you a extra action.
    - Cannot fail a morale test if it involves pain to you.
    // second one is pretty vague  

- Axe Warden
    - Test DR10 Strength to disarm someone with your axe, warpick, polearm or scyth. Can use this as a defence test
    - Attacking the environment doesn't damage your weapon.

- Baned hunter
    - Exposing the blood of a creature allows you to see their next action for D4 rounds. //Drinking blood instead, feel their intention 
    - Exposing your own blood lures aggressive creatures to your location. // Your blood when spilled travels towards the closest injured creature
    // weird one, puts a lot of work onto the dm, and removes enemies being able to addept to changing conditions

- Shamon
    - Can spend an omen to perform a ritual that changes an aspect of the weather.
    - Test DR13 to foresee the upcoming weather.
