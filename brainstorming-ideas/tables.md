we've got basically 3 options:

1. copy-paste whatever we have in inkscape, slap in the character sheet, and call it a day

2. rework the graphic design of everything, add a bit of art while still keeping it similar, combine with the character sheet n dm tables, and call it a day

3. (this is the big option) take a week, or two to get all the rules finished; Then go full on with figuring an art style and making it look closer to the MB book, (but Black Metal instead of Doom); Make a few pages with art for preview; Find someone to be willing to print and ship it; run a funding campaign; Get peeps hyped for it; and actually make a full on book. (possibly even get wiz to help out with graphic design given that it was his job?)

I'd prob want the 3rd, but that is a... yeah lot of work; Obviously doable if we don't rush it, but still a lot of work. Although the pay off is waay greater (munnies and making a full on book)
